# MoniGarr

Foundational AI Systems • Language Technology • AI Governance

MoniGarr is an independent AI research and engineering practice focused on the design, stewardship, and long-term governance of AI systems operating in high-risk language, cultural, and institutional contexts.

This work predates modern large language models and spans pre-LLM conversational systems, custom NLP pipelines, reinforcement learning systems, and contemporary model architectures.

The emphasis is durability over scale, judgment over output, and institutional trust over visibility.

## Research Focus

**Indigenous & Low-Resource Language AI**
- Custom tokenizers and language models for polysynthetic languages (Kanien’kéha)
- Morphology-aware NLP pipelines
- Data sovereignty and language stewardship–aligned system design

**Reinforcement Learning Systems**
- Modernized SAC agents for Gymnasium-compatible environments
- Reproducible RL research pipelines with evaluation, logging, and model cards
- Applied RL for environments where failure modes matter

**AI Infrastructure & Tooling**
- Research-grade ML pipelines
- Synthetic data workflows
- AI-first developer systems for edge-case domains
